1. Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during last night's
class (2020-09-09), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to
solve people's problems that you have come up with as a result of
listening to other students.

One of the apps mentioned by a fellow student of mine was an app that tracks
who has fed the pets.  I know growing up that this was a big thing my family
would always wonder about.  It definitely would have made my family's lives
easier.


2. Several people mentioned the "conflict" between the desire to have
a free app, and developers' desire (and need) to get compensated. Can
you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity's
and efforts' rewards without alienating their "customer base" by
inundating with ads and/or charging them.

A developer could create a social media app that is free to use, but as it
gets more popular, the creators that are using the app begin to make money
off of it.  The developer could then start to charge those creators a tax
 and therefore start to make profit off of their app.


3. Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your
opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its
UI/UX to be so good.

I think TikTok has a great UI/UX experience.  The app works absolutely
 perfect. I picked up on how to use it really easily.  The algorithm
  in which TikTok finds videos that their users might find interesting is
  spot on.


4. Have last night's class discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you
closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for
this course? Please discuss briefly.

Yes, I have certainly started to think about an app that would be useful
to not only me, but other people.
